An advanced slack bot for lunch managing.

You need to set only the token for slack, when you start it you can set
all the configurations directly inside the chat.

Every day it will send a message in the channel, and directly to all the people enable direct notification, 
taking the count of how many people are participating.  
After n hours/minutes it will start writing directly to each person asking the possible hours and places to go.  
At a certain hour it will write in the channel the result, the best hour, the best place and people count.  
If there are conflicts it tries to fi them writing directly to interested people.  
You need only to book the place it writes and then press the booked button, if there are problem you can press 
booking problems. In case of booking problems it will automatically change the place, if it's possible.
